### What is SQL?

- **Structured Query Language**
- is a **language** designed to allow both technical and non-technical users **query**, **manipulate**, and **transform data** from a relational database.
- due to its _simplicity_, SQL databases provide _safe_ and _scalable storage_ for millions of websites and mobile applications.

`There are many popular SQL databases including

1. SQLite
2. MySQL
3. Postgres
4. Oracle
5. Microsoft SQL Server.
   All of them support the common SQL language standard, but each implementation can differ in the additional features and storage types it supports.
